                    <h2>How The Last of Us became a cult game, and its sequel became a scandal</h2>

                        -- What happens in the original game and its sequel
                    Released in 2013, TLOU takes place 20 years after a global catastrophe caused by a mutated fungus. The survivors have to live in quarantine zones guarded by the military. Outside the cities, which exist almost according to prison rules, it is even more unpleasant: travelers are waiting for the infected, cannibals and just bandits.
                    The first TLOU tells a love story set in a brutal zombie apocalypse. The authors talk about what parents are ready to go for the sake of their child. And in this context, love is not only a blessing, but also a reason for monstrous deeds. Druckmann was helped to work on the script by the thoughts and emotions caused by the birth of his daughter, and the idea was repeatedly expressed that the attitude towards the final depends on whether the player has a child or not.
                    - Why did the game become a cult?
                    It markedly influenced the entire gaming industry, primarily showing that the level of development of the script and characters in video games can not be inferior to blockbusters and great TV shows. The game lasts about fifteen hours, and during this time it is impossible not to become attached to the main characters.
                    -- Scandals around the dilogy
                    A few months before the release of the second part of the game, several videos with spoilers were leaked to the network. Sony quickly removed them, but copies with text descriptions of the scenes went around the Internet. Those gifs and videos were taken out of context and mixed with outright fiction. For example, shortly before the release of the game, many were convinced that Part II contained a scene of sex between a character similar to Neil Druckmann and a transgender person. The press, which received copies of the game, could not refute these fakes, as they were embargoed. It also turned out that in Part II, the developers destroyed the romantic images of the heroes of the first game and, in addition, in order to keep the main plot twists in secret, used fake scenes in the trailers.
                    Neil Druckmann calls a drain day "the worst day of my life." He received many threats on social networks, the public remembered him for frequent discussions about the representation of various social groups in games and public admiration for the activities of femactivist Anita Sarkisyan, one of the heroines of the “gamergate” that changed the video game industry.
